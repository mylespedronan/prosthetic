This folder contains the 3D modesl created in Blender 3D. The different iterations in the models
show the different changes created between each model. These differences include creation of meshes,
rigging, normalization, and weight painting. The model chosen to be imported to Unity is "Human5".

The models have room for improvement with rigging and weight painting in order to better maintain
the deformation of the mesh. 

The models imported are in the 3D Models Folder.
