The purpose of this project is to develop a voice recognition interface with a prosthetic limb.

This project utilizes voice recognition software via an Android application that communicates with a ESP-32 microcontroller and a prosthesis.

The user interacts with the application through the use of voice commands to control the different components of the prosthesis in order to 
aid the user in moving the component in any given direction. This project utilizes Android Studio, Blender 3D, Arduino IDE, and Unity in 
order to demonstrate the results of the system.

In order to demonstrate the results of the project, 3D models created in Blender were imported into the Unity 3D engine to
show visual representation of a completed exoskeleton as well as a human hand. The 3D models are designed to represent a human in order 
to show the different limbs capable of moving as well as the different grips from the use of the embedded system. 

This basis for an interface allows for further improvement as this project develops in future interations. As each component of the human 
model is able to be moved, the project can be expanded to allow for representation of additional physical components of the exoskeleton that are
created. 

This repository is organized to hold the files of the applications in their own respected folders.
